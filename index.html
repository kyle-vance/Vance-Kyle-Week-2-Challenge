<h2>About me</h2>
<Section id="About-me">
<p>
Hi there, I'm Kyle. I am learning full-stack development as a student at the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. My background is in healthcare. I am certified Physician Assistant currently practicing as a primary care provider in Layton, UT with current subspecialities of urgent care, endocrinology, medical cannabis therapy, correctional behavior (caring for inmates), and dermatology. <br><br>
So why leave? Well, that's a tricky question to answer; but ultimately it came down to happiness. I just wasn't happy doing it. Some of the other reasons include: liability, stress, inflexibile work schedule, relatively capped pay and poor job market/outlook, and being a part of a doomed and broken healthcare system, and COVID burnout. I decided I need to make a move. Computers have always been a big part of my life--from gaming, to building PCs for myself and friends, troubleshooting, etc. Software development offers me everything that I am looking for in a new career: flexibility, great pay, job satisfaction, job outlook and market, remote work, and being able to see my kids more often. <br> <br>
I plan to incoorperate my background as a medical provider with my new software development skills develop medical software. <br><br>
Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family which consists of my beautiful wife, 2 boys, 2 dogs and cat. I also enjoy playing computer and board games, making and listening to music, travel, and home renovations.
